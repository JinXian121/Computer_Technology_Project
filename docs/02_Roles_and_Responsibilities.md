# ðŸ‘¥ Roles & Responsibilities

Clearly defined roles ensure everyone knows what is expected of them, which improves accountability and reduces confusion.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Leads meetings, maintains the project timeline, assigns tasks via GitHub Issues, manages the GitHub repository, and acts as the primary point of contact for escalations. |
| **Developer** | Writes and tests code, creates features, fixes bugs, commits code regularly following the contribution guidelines, and participates in Pull Request reviews. |
| **Documenter / QA** | Maintains the `README.md`, `docs/`, and other documentation. Writes and executes test plans, raises bug reports in GitHub Issues, and verifies fixes. |
| **Designer (if applicable)**| Creates wireframes, UI mockups, and prototypes (e.g., in Figma). Provides feedback on user experience and ensures design consistency. |
| **Researcher** | Gathers insights, investigates new libraries or APIs, conducts analysis, and provides technical briefs to the team on potential solutions. |

*Note: All roles are expected to use GitHub Issues for task tracking and follow the branching and PR strategy outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.*
