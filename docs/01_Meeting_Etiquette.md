## During the Meeting
-   **Work *with* the AI notetaker**: Everything you say is transcribed. This transcription will be processed through an LLM and important information can be extracted. This includes key decisions made during the meeting, follow-up tasks and who they were assigned to. But, clarity is important so ensure you provide the LLM with as much additinal information and context as possible. 
-   **Speak slowly and clearly**: Especially if what you are saying is important and you don't want to have to repeat yourself. 
-   **Introductions**: When speaking for the first time, introduce yourself with your **full name and role**.
-   **Follow the Structure**:
    1.  PM opens the meeting, stating the context and agenda.
    2.  Each team member speaks in turn, covering:
        -   Last week’s goals (Achieved? Y/N)
        -   This week’s goals
        -   Any questions or blockers.
    3.  PM summarises the discussion and drives task assignments.
-   **Speak Clearly**: When speaking, be clear, concise, and to the point.

## After the Meeting
-   **Confirm Tasks**: All key decisions and action items must be clearly stated, with an assigned owner and a due date.
-   **Review Notes**: The AI-generated transcript serves as the official record. Review it for accuracy.
