## Overview

This guide helps you manage your team project using GitHub's built-in tools:
- **Issues**: Track tasks, bugs, and ideas
- **Projects**: Visualize workflow with Kanban boards
- **Milestones**: Group work toward deadlines
- **Labels**: Categorize and filter work

All tools are integrated, creating a seamless workflow from idea to implementation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup Checklist

- [ ] All team members have repository access
- [ ] Project board created (see [PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md](../.github/PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md))
- [ ] Labels configured (see [labels.yml](../.github/labels.yml))
- [ ] First milestone created
- [ ] Team roles assigned
- [ ] Weekly meeting schedule set

### 2. Understanding the Tools

```
Repository
├── Issues (Tasks, Bugs, Ideas)
├── Projects (Visual Workflow)
├── Milestones (Time-based Goals)
└── Labels (Categories)
```

## Issue Workflow

### Creating Issues

1. **Choose the Right Template**
   - `task.md`: General tasks
   - `bug.md`: Problems to fix
   - `feature.md`: New functionality
   - `meeting-notes.md`: Meeting records
   - `weekly-goal.md`: Weekly objectives
   - `research.md`: Investigation tasks

2. **Write Clear Titles**
   - Bad: "Fix bug"
   - Good: "[BUG] Login button unresponsive on mobile devices"

3. **Provide Complete Information**
   - Context/background
   - Specific requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Related issues/PRs

### Issue Lifecycle

graph LR
    A[Create] --> B[Assign]
    B --> C[In Progress]
    C --> D[Review]
    D --> E[Close]
    D --> C
```

#### 1. Create
- Use appropriate template
- Add relevant labels
- Link to milestone
- Estimate effort (if using story points)

#### 2. Assign
- Assign to team member(s)
- Move to "To Do" column
- Set priority label
- Add to current sprint/week

#### 3. Work
- Move to "In Progress"
- Create feature branch
- Regular commits with issue references
- Update issue with progress comments

#### 4. Review
- Create Pull Request
- Link PR to issue (use "Fixes #123")
- Request code review
- Move to "Review" column

#### 5. Close
- Merge PR (auto-closes issue)
- Or manually close with explanation
- Moves to "Done" column

### Issue Best Practices

```yaml
DO:
  - One issue per discrete task
  - Update status regularly
  - Link related issues
  - Use @ mentions for attention
  - Add screenshots when helpful

DON'T:
  - Create vague issues
  - Leave issues unassigned
  - Work without an issue
  - Close without explanation
  - Ignore stale issues
```

## Using GitHub Projects

### Project Board Structure

Our standard board has 5 columns:

| Column | Purpose | When to Move Items |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Backlog** | Future work | When identified |
| **To Do** | This week's work | During planning |
| **In Progress** | Active work | When starting |
| **Review** | Needs review | PR created |
| **Done** | Completed | PR merged |

### Daily Workflow

```markdown
Morning:
1. Check "To Do" column
2. Pick highest priority unassigned item
3. Assign to yourself
4. Move to "In Progress"

During Work:
1. Update issue with progress
2. Push commits regularly
3. Ask for help if blocked

End of Day:
1. Update issue status
2. Move blocked items back
3. Comment on progress
```

### Using Views and Filters

Create custom views for:
- **My Work**: `assignee:@me`
- **This Week**: Current milestone
- **Blocked**: `label:"status: blocked"`
- **High Priority**: `label:"priority: high"`

### Automation Tips

Set up these automations:
1. Issues → "To Do" when added to project
2. Issues → "In Progress" when branch created
3. Issues → "Review" when PR opened
4. Issues → "Done" when closed

## Milestone Management

### Aligning with Course Requirements

Map course deliverables to milestones:

```
Course Timeline          GitHub Milestones
├── Week 1-2      →     Sprint 1 - Setup & Planning
├── Week 3-4      →     Sprint 2 - Core Features
├── Week 5-6      →     Sprint 3 - Enhancement
├── Week 7-8      →     Sprint 4 - Testing
├── Week 9-10     →     Sprint 5 - Polish
├── Week 11       →     MVP Release
└── Week 12       →     Final Submission
```

### Sprint Planning with Milestones

1. **Before Sprint**
   - Review upcoming milestone
   - Check course requirements
   - Estimate team capacity

2. **During Planning**
   - Move items from Backlog
   - Assign to milestone
   - Distribute among team
   - Set priority labels

3. **During Sprint**
   - Track milestone progress
   - Adjust scope if needed
   - Document blockers

4. **Sprint End**
   - Review completion
   - Move incomplete items
   - Document lessons learned

## Weekly Reports Integration

### Automated Report Generation

Our weekly reports pull data from:
- **Completed**: Issues closed this week
- **In Progress**: Open issues in milestone
- **Blockers**: Issues with blocked label
- **Next Week**: Issues in next milestone

### Report Workflow

```
Monday: Plan Week
├── Create weekly goal issue
├── Review milestone progress
└── Assign week's work

Friday: Generate Report
├── Run report script
├── Review generated content
├── Add qualitative insights
└── Submit report
```

### Linking Reports to Project Data

In your weekly report:
```markdown
## Completed This Week
