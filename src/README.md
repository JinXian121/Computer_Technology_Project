# 🧠 AI Research Paper Scraper

This tool is a Python-based command-line application that scrapes academic research papers from **arXiv** and uses a **pretrained AI model** to automatically **classify** them by topic. It's designed to help researchers, students, and developers quickly find and categorize scholarly articles related to domains like Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Robotics, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Keyword Search**: Users can input any topic to find related research papers.
- 📚 **Scrapes from arXiv API**: Reliable source for up-to-date scientific articles.
- 🧠 **Zero-Shot Classification**: Automatically tags articles using a pretrained NLP model (`facebook/bart-large-mnli`) via Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.
- 📦 **JSON Output**: Stores the results in a structured, reusable JSON format.
- 🕓 **Reading Time Estimation**: Calculates how long it would take to read the summary.
- 🛠️ **Customizable Topics**: Easily edit the list of target topics to fit your domain.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. User runs the script.
2. Prompted to:
   - Enter a **search keyword**
   - Choose how many **articles** to retrieve
   - Choose whether to **append** or **overwrite** existing data
3. The tool fetches articles from arXiv, classifies each by topic using AI, and stores them into `output/arxiv_articles.json`.

## 🧠 AI Model

- **Model**: `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Pipeline**: `zero-shot-classification` from 🤗 [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- **Why Zero-Shot?**: No training required. The model can predict topics from a given set of labels without needing labeled data.

## 📦 Output Format (JSON)

Each paper is saved in the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "Paper Title",
  "date": "2025-09-01",
