## Best Practices for Milestones

### 1. Planning
- Create milestones at the start of the project
- Align with course schedule and deadlines
- Include buffer time for unexpected issues

### 2. Scope Management
- Be realistic about what can be achieved
- Prioritize must-have vs nice-to-have features
- Leave room for testing and documentation

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Regularly update milestone progress
- Move incomplete items to next milestone
- Document reasons for changes

### 4. Team Communication
- Discuss milestones in team meetings
- Ensure everyone knows the deadlines
- Celebrate milestone completions!

## Milestone Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create milestone using template
   - Add relevant issues
   - Assign team members

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Track progress weekly
   - Update issue status
   - Address blockers quickly

3. **Review Phase**
   - Check completion criteria
   - Document lessons learned
   - Plan for next milestone

## Integration with Other Tools

### Project Board
- Create a column for each active milestone
- Filter board view by milestone
- Track milestone progress visually

### Weekly Reports
- Reference milestone progress
- Highlight risks to milestone completion
- Plan week's work based on milestone needs

### Issues and PRs
- Always link to relevant milestone
- Use milestone view to see all related work
- Close milestone only when all issues resolved

## Quick Commands

- Link issue to milestone: Use dropdown in issue sidebar
- View milestone progress: Click on milestone name
- Filter by milestone: Use `milestone:"Milestone Name"` in search
- Bulk update: Select multiple issues and update milestone

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-scoping**: Don't pack too much into one milestone
2. **Vague Criteria**: Be specific about what "done" means
3. **Ignoring Dependencies**: Plan for external factors
4. **No Buffer Time**: Always include contingency
5. **Poor Communication**: Keep team informed of changes

Remember: Milestones are a tool to help you succeed, not a source of stress. Use them to stay organized, track progress, and celebrate achievements!
